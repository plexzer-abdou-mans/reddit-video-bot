this program was created by plexzer999 on github if you want to report someone who is 
reposting this as a work of his own contact me on my instagram "plexzer_999"
all you need to operate this program is a gameplay mp4 file and having a reddit api credentials 
and an elevenlabs api key
have fun rotting the brain of low attention span low intelegence parts of the population 
and do contact me when you use it if you want so i can see my creation in action


***update notes***
my silly ass cant be a software engineer i forgot to test the code ðŸ’€
anyways it works now 
note that you need to have ffmpeg in your system path folder (check yt for tutorials) 
also pip instal or brew thw remaining api's
and again have fun
